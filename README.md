What I want to do after high school is to play sports or go to college for cybersecurity.
I want to be able to Swipe my credit card and not worry about how much money I'm losing. 
I want to retire my mom. After high school, I need to eventually retire my mother.
I need to be able to pay off all her debt so she can live happily for the rest of her life.
I want my mom to be able to live the life she actually wants to live not work until she rots and dies.
I need to make sure that my younger brother does not grow up with my dad's side of the family as there all a bunch of low-life losers.
And I want to be able to just live my life peacefully and just die and that's all I want and that's all I need.
So I chose to do all of this is because I started to learn that to be able to achieve this life I can't just go to school and do what they tell me to do. 
Why? Well because school systems were put in place for the government to brainwash American children into believing that if you study study study you can make a good life.
but the only problem is you have to work until you die. So they set you up to learn a whole bunch of Bullcrap. Everything is limited by what the government wants you to learn.
They want you to work your life they don't want you to enjoy your life. because they don't want too many people to have too much money because then those people don't work.
those people don't stay average and they aren't like everybody else. So as I sit in school with my math class this year I learned something.
The school was tryna teach me that a guy named Dave Ramsey had done a survey on who are millionaires and it highlighted teachers being one of them. and I clearly knew that that was a lie
Because teachers don't make over 100k per year. And if you think about it Most teachers are women. So how many of those women divorced and got money from the man? 
That's the only way I can see them coming close to even making just 1 million nothing above that. is it possible that they didn't do that im sure but does it seem likely to me No.
I learned that I don't want to be average. I don't want everyone else's lifestyle to be average work until you rot and die. That's not a happy life for me.
So School helped me with the basics but there was also information ALOT of information they were trying to teach me that would only get me the average lifestyle. 
Living the lifestyle my teachers have and I don't want that at all it's not fun it's not worth it to me It's pointless to me. 
And the school system punishes you for not learning to become average and work the rest of your life until you die because of the grading system You focus on things that will get you
where you want to be but since that's not what the school is tryna teach you it's not right so you get Bad grades because you didn't focus on the stuff they were giving you.
I just want to enjoy my life work hard for what I want and just be left alone and die that's all. Im not gonna work a 9-5 until i die its not happening im not dealing with it.
I dont care what anyone else says either. Their opinions dont matter and they never will.
